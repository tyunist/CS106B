     *  a custom struct/class as the key type, then we could just
     *  use a pointT as the key of the map. All we needed to do was
     *  to write a custom comparator function that the Map would use
     *  to identify duplicates.
     *
     *  Either way, if we would solve this problem using the older version,
     *  we should specify a string serialization of the struct.
